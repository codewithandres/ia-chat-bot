# AI-Powered Chat Bot with File Upload and Emoji Support

This project implements an interactive chat bot interface with AI-driven responses, file upload capabilities, and emoji support. It provides a seamless user experience for engaging with an AI assistant through a web-based interface.

The chat bot application is built using TypeScript and Vite, offering a modern development environment with fast build times and optimized performance. It features a responsive design, real-time message updates, and animated transitions for a polished user interface.

Key features of this chat bot include:
- Real-time messaging with AI-generated responses
- File upload and preview functionality
- Emoji picker integration for enhanced expression
- Animated message transitions using Animate.css
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Usage Instructions

### Installation

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 6 or higher)

To install the project dependencies, run the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

### Getting Started

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in the console output) to view the chat bot interface.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate optimized static files in the `dist` directory.

### Configuration

The chat bot's behavior can be customized by modifying the following files:
- `src/constants/index.ts`: Adjust chat history settings
- `src/utils/emjojinPiker.ts`: Configure emoji picker options
- `src/services/api.ts`: Modify API endpoints for bot responses

### Common Use Cases

1. Sending a message:
   - Type your message in the input field
   - Press Enter or click the send button

2. Uploading a file:
   - Click the file upload button
   - Select a file from your device
   - The file preview will appear in the chat interface

3. Using emojis:
   - Click the emoji picker button
   - Select an emoji to insert it into your message

4. Toggling chat bot visibility:
   - Click the chat bot toggle button to show/hide the chat interface

### Troubleshooting

1. Issue: Chat bot not responding
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify that the API endpoint in `src/services/api.ts` is correct
   - Look for any console errors in the browser developer tools

2. Issue: File upload not working
   - Ensure that the file type is supported
   - Check if the file size exceeds any limits set in the backend

3. Issue: Emoji picker not displaying
   - Verify that the EmojiMart library is properly imported
   - Check for any console errors related to the emoji picker initialization

### Debugging

To enable debug mode:
1. Open `src/main.ts`
2. Add the following line at the beginning of the file:
   ```typescript
   const DEBUG = true;
   ```
3. Use `console.log()` statements throughout the code, wrapped in conditions like:
   ```typescript
   if (DEBUG) {
     console.log('Debug information:', someVariable);
   }
   ```

Log files are not generated by default in this front-end application. For production deployments, consider implementing a logging service to capture and analyze user interactions and errors.

## Data Flow

The chat bot application follows a straightforward data flow for handling user interactions and bot responses:

1. User Input: The user types a message or uploads a file through the interface.
2. Message Processing: The input is captured and processed by event listeners in `main.ts`.
3. UI Update: The user's message is immediately displayed in the chat interface.
4. Bot Response Request: A request is sent to the bot API (implemented in `services/api.ts`).
5. Response Rendering: The bot's response is received and rendered in the chat interface using `screens/renderBotResponse.ts`.
6. State Management: The chat history is updated in the `chatHistory` Set defined in `constants/index.ts`.

```
[User Input] -> [Message Processing] -> [UI Update]
                         |
                         v
[State Management] <- [Response Rendering] <- [Bot Response Request]
```

Note: Ensure that the bot API endpoint is properly configured in the `services/api.ts` file for successful communication with the AI backend.
